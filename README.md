# Unreal Engine project
## Description
Customer project for the entire academic year on my third year at Aalto.
Our team implemented an Aliens vs Humans first-person shooter game with Unreal Engine 5 and C++ using Scrum. 
The project involved interviews and testing with potential users/customers for planning and evaluation.
## Sprints
We used two-week sprints with one sprint being exceptionally four weeks long during the Christmas break.
The Sprint Ceremonies were organized at Aalto University.
In the Sprint Planning, the customer reprioritized task items in our product backlog and selected new tasks to be done in the starting sprint from it. Next, we did effort estimation for the selected tasks and used story points. Then we assigned those tasks for our team members based on interests so that everyone had approximately equally work to do.
In the Sprint Review, all team members demonstrated their completed tasks to our customer and received feedback from him.
In the Sprint Retrospective, all team members and our customer were asked to write thoughts on Post-it notes for what to be extremely proud of, what went well, what did not work, and what to improve. Those notes were put to an whiteboard and then discussed together.
## Where is the code?
Since the code is made for a customer it cannot be published here but here is a link to our team's trailer for the courses demo gala:
